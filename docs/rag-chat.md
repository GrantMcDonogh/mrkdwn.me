# RAG Chat

## Overview

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chat panel allows users to ask questions about their vault content and receive AI-generated answers grounded in their notes. It appears as a right panel in the app layout, streaming responses via Convex httpActions.

The chat supports two modes:

1. **Q&A Mode** (default) — Read-only question answering powered by the Anthropic API (Claude). Always available.
2. **Edit Mode** — Question answering plus the ability to edit and create notes, powered by OpenRouter. Requires the user to configure an OpenRouter API key via the Settings dialog.

## Architecture

### Q&A Mode

```
Client (ChatPanel)
  |
  | POST /api/chat
  | Authorization: Bearer <convex-token>
  | Body: { vaultId, message }
  |
  v
Convex httpAction (convex/chat.ts)
  |
  | 1. Authenticate via ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()
  | 2. Validate request body (vaultId, message)
  | 3. Build context via chatHelpers.buildContext (internal query)
  | 4. Call Anthropic API (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929) with stream: true
  | 5. Stream response via TransformStream
  |
  v
TransformStream → streamed response back to client
```

### Edit Mode

```
Client (ChatPanel)
  |
  | POST /api/chat-edit
  | Authorization: Bearer <convex-token>
  | Body: { vaultId, message, activeNoteId? }
  |
  v
Convex httpAction (convex/chatEdit.ts)
  |
  | 1. Authenticate via ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()
  | 2. Retrieve user's OpenRouter key via userSettings.getOpenRouterKey
  | 3. Build context via chatEditHelpers.buildEditContext (includes active note)
  | 4. Call OpenRouter API (anthropic/claude-sonnet-4) with stream: true
  | 5. Stream response via TransformStream
  |
  v
TransformStream → streamed response back to client
  |
  v
Client parses edit/create blocks → renders EditBlockCard with DiffView
```

### Why httpAction?

Convex queries and mutations don't support streaming responses. The chat endpoints use `httpAction` which can return arbitrary HTTP responses, including streaming via `TransformStream`. Authentication uses the built-in `ctx.auth.getUserIdentity()` which validates the Clerk JWT passed in the `Authorization` header.

### Context Building

**Q&A mode:** Context is built by `convex/chatHelpers.ts`, an `internalQuery` called `buildContext`. It performs a dual-index search (title + content, 15 results each), merges and deduplicates, then builds a two-tier context string. If no search results match, it falls back to fetching 15 notes by the `by_vault` index.

**Edit mode:** Context is built by `convex/chatEditHelpers.ts`, an `internalQuery` called `buildEditContext`. It follows the same dual-index search pattern but additionally accepts an `activeNoteId` parameter. When provided, the active note's full content is included first (labelled as "ACTIVE NOTE") before adding search results. The active note is excluded from search results to avoid duplication.

> **Note:** Vault ownership is not explicitly verified in the chat endpoints — any authenticated user who knows a vault ID could potentially query its notes.

## Context Building

The context builder uses a two-tier approach to maximize relevance within the token budget:

### Tier 1: Full Content (Top 5 Notes)

- Notes are selected by searching the vault using the user's question as a query.
- The top 5 results include their full markdown content.
- These provide Claude with detailed information to answer from.

### Tier 2: Title Only (Next 10 Notes)

- The next 10 search results include only their title.
- These give Claude awareness of related notes without consuming the context budget.

### Budget

- Total context is capped at **80,000 characters**.
- Notes are added in relevance order until the cap is reached.
- Blocks are separated by `---` markers.

## API Endpoints

### `POST /api/chat` (Q&A Mode)

**Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer <convex-auth-token>` — Required

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "vaultId": "<vault-id>",
  "message": "What are the key points from my project notes?"
}
```

**Response:** Streamed plain text (content-type: `text/plain; charset=utf-8`). Tokens arrive as they are generated.

**Error Responses:**

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| 401 | No valid user identity |
| 400 | Missing `vaultId` or `message` in request body |
| 403 | `buildContext` returned null |
| 500 | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var not set |
| 502 | Claude API returned a non-OK response |

### `POST /api/chat-edit` (Edit Mode)

**Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer <convex-auth-token>` — Required

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "vaultId": "<vault-id>",
  "message": "Add a summary section to my project notes",
  "activeNoteId": "<note-id>"  // optional, the currently open note
}
```

**Response:** Streamed plain text. May contain edit/create blocks (see Edit Block Syntax below).

**Error Responses:**

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| 401 | No valid user identity |
| 400 | Missing `vaultId` or `message`, OpenRouter API key not configured, or OpenRouter API returned a non-OK response (JSON body: `{ error: "..." }`) |
| 403 | `buildEditContext` returned null |
| 500 | Server error |

### CORS

Both endpoints echo the request's `Origin` header in `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (with `Vary: origin`) and handle OPTIONS preflight requests.

## System Prompts

### Q&A Mode

The system prompt instructs Claude to:

- Answer **only** from the provided vault notes
- Cite note titles when referencing content
- Say "I don't have enough information in your notes to answer that" when context is insufficient
- Note discrepancies between notes
- Use markdown formatting in responses
- Be concise and factual

### Edit Mode

The system prompt instructs the AI to:

- Answer questions about vault notes (same as Q&A mode)
- Edit existing notes when asked, using `````edit:Note Title` blocks
- Create new notes when asked, using `````create:New Note Title` blocks
- Output **complete replacement content** (not partial diffs) inside edit blocks
- Explain changes in natural language before the edit/create block
- Preserve parts of notes the user didn't ask to change
- Use `[[Wiki Link]]` syntax in note content

## Edit Block Syntax

When the AI edits or creates notes in edit mode, it outputs fenced blocks:

```
````edit:Note Title
...full new content of the note...
````

````create:New Note Title
...content of the new note...
````
```

These blocks are parsed client-side by `parseEditBlocks()` (`src/lib/parseEditBlocks.ts`) which extracts the type (`edit` or `create`), note title, and content using a regex. The `stripEditBlocks()` function removes these blocks from the displayed message text so the user sees only the natural language explanation.

## Frontend

### ChatPanel

**File:** `src/components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx`

Displayed in the right panel when `rightPanel === "chat"`.

#### UI Structure

```
Chat Panel
+-- Header
|   +-- "Chat" label
|   +-- "Edit mode" badge (shown when OpenRouter key is configured)
|   +-- Clear chat button (Trash2 icon, shown when messages exist)
|   +-- Settings button (Settings icon, opens SettingsDialog)
+-- Message List (scrollable)
|   +-- User Message
|   +-- Assistant Message (streaming)
|   |   +-- EditBlockCard(s) (if edit mode, after streaming completes)
|   +-- ...
+-- Input Area
    +-- Text input + Send button
```

#### Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Message history | Displays conversation in the current session |
| Streaming display | Assistant responses appear token-by-token |
| Auto-scroll | Scrolls to bottom as new tokens arrive |
| Send on Enter | Enter key sends the message |
| Loading state | Disabled input while waiting for response |
| Edit mode badge | Purple "Edit mode" badge shown when OpenRouter key is configured |
| Clear chat | Trash icon to clear all messages |
| Settings access | Settings gear icon opens the SettingsDialog |

#### Mode Selection

The chat panel automatically selects the endpoint based on the user's OpenRouter key status:

- **No key configured** → Q&A mode (`/api/chat`), placeholder: "Ask about your notes..."
- **Key configured** → Edit mode (`/api/chat-edit`), placeholder: "Ask about or edit your notes...", active note ID is passed to the backend

### ChatMessage

**File:** `src/components/chat/ChatMessage.tsx`

Renders individual user or assistant messages with appropriate styling. For assistant messages in edit mode:

- The message text is displayed with edit blocks stripped out (via `stripEditBlocks`)
- Each parsed `EditBlock` is rendered as an `EditBlockCard` below the message text

### EditBlockCard

**File:** `src/components/chat/EditBlockCard.tsx`

Renders an interactive card for each edit/create block proposed by the AI:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Header | Icon (Pencil for edit, FilePlus for create) + note title + status badge |
| DiffView | Line-by-line diff comparing original content vs proposed changes |
| Error | Warning if the target note is not found in the vault |
| Actions | "Apply Changes" and "Dismiss" buttons (hidden after resolution) |

**Apply logic:**
- **Edit**: Finds the note by title (case-insensitive), calls `notes.update` with the new content
- **Create**: Calls `notes.create` then `notes.update` with content, opens the new note via `OPEN_NOTE` dispatch

**Status flow:** `pending` → `applied` or `dismissed`

### DiffView

**File:** `src/components/chat/DiffView.tsx`

Renders a line-by-line diff between original and proposed content using the `diff` package (`diffLines`). Added lines are green, removed lines are red with strikethrough, and unchanged lines are muted.

### useChatStream

**File:** `src/components/chat/useChatStream.ts`

Custom hook that manages the streaming fetch lifecycle:

1. Sends POST request to `/api/chat` or `/api/chat-edit` based on `options.useEditEndpoint`.
2. For edit mode, includes `activeNoteId` in the request body.
3. On error responses, attempts to parse JSON body (`{ error: "..." }`) for a clean error message, falling back to plain text.
4. Reads the response body as a stream via `ReadableStream`.
5. Decodes chunks and appends to the current assistant message.
6. After streaming completes in edit mode, parses edit blocks via `parseEditBlocks()`.
7. Exposes `updateBlockStatus(messageIndex, blockIndex, status)` for tracking apply/dismiss state.

### SettingsDialog

**File:** `src/components/settings/SettingsDialog.tsx`

Modal dialog for managing user settings, accessible from the chat panel header (Settings icon) or the command palette ("Open Settings").

#### Features

- **View key status**: Shows masked key (`sk-or-••••••••`) when configured
- **Test key**: "Test" button validates the key against OpenRouter's free `GET /api/v1/auth/key` endpoint via the `/api/test-openrouter-key` backend route. Shows green "Key is valid" on success or a red error message on failure. Test status resets when the input changes.
- **Save key**: Text input with "Save" button, validates non-empty
- **Replace key**: Enter a new key when one already exists
- **Remove key**: "Remove" button to delete the stored key
- **External link**: Link to [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) to obtain a key
- **Status feedback**: Success ("Key saved successfully") and error messages

## Workspace Integration

The workspace state's `rightPanel` union type includes `"chat"`:

```typescript
rightPanel: "backlinks" | "graph" | "search" | "chat" | null;
```

The chat panel is toggled via a toolbar button (MessageSquare icon) or the command palette.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Where | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Convex env vars | API key for Claude API calls (Q&A mode) |

The OpenRouter API key for edit mode is stored per-user in the `userSettings` database table (not as an environment variable). Users configure it via the Settings dialog.
